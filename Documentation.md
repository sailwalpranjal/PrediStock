## Introduction

**PrediStock** aims to bridge the gap between data science and financial forecasting by leveraging historical stock data to predict future trends. This tool is particularly useful for traders, investors, and financial analysts who need to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

## Architecture

The architecture of PrediStock is designed to be modular and scalable, consisting of the following layers:

- **Data Layer:** Handles the collection and storage of historical stock data.
- **Processing Layer:** Prepares and cleans data for analysis.
- **Prediction Layer:** Implements machine learning models to predict stock prices.
- **Output Layer:** Displays the results in a user-friendly format, such as graphs or tables.

## Installation

To install and set up PrediStock, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sailwalpranjal/PrediStock.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PrediStock
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go get ./...
   ```

## Build and Run

To build and run the PrediStock application, execute the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
go build ./cmd/PrediStock
./PrediStock
```

The application will start processing data and eventually output predictions based on the implemented model.

## Core Components

### Data Collection

The data collection module is responsible for gathering historical stock data from various APIs. This data serves as the foundation for all subsequent analysis and predictions.

#### Key Features:
- **API Integration:** Fetches data from multiple reliable sources.
- **Error Handling:** Ensures the system continues to function even if one data source fails.
- **Data Caching:** Stores previously fetched data to reduce API calls and improve efficiency.

### Data Preprocessing

Once the data is collected, it undergoes a preprocessing pipeline where it's cleaned, normalized, and prepared for analysis.

#### Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning:** Removes any irrelevant or erroneous data points.
- **Normalization:** Ensures that the data is in a consistent format suitable for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Adds new derived features that could improve the modelâ€™s predictive accuracy.

### Prediction Model

The heart of PrediStock lies in its predictive model. This module applies machine learning algorithms to the preprocessed data to forecast future stock prices.

#### Key Features:
- **Algorithm Selection:** Supports multiple algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- **Model Training:** Automatically trains models on historical data.
- **Cross-Validation:** Ensures that the model is validated to prevent overfitting.

### Result Interpretation

After predictions are made, the results are presented in a clear and comprehensible format. This could include visualizations, summaries, and alerts.

#### Key Features:
- **Graphical Representation:** Provides charts and graphs for easy interpretation.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Flags any unusual trends that might require further investigation.
- **Export Options:** Allows users to export results in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF).
- **Real-Time Data Processing:** Integrate real-time data feeds for live prediction.

## Key Code Snippets

### Data Collection Code

```go
package datacollection

import (
    "net/http"
    "io/ioutil"
    "encoding/json"
    "log"
)

// FetchData fetches historical data from the stock API
func FetchData(symbol string) (StockData, error) {
    url := "https://api.example.com/stocks/" + symbol
    resp, err := http.Get(url)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Error fetching data: %v", err)
        return StockData{}, err
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Error reading response: %v", err)
        return StockData{}, err
    }

    var data StockData
    if err := json.Unmarshal(body, &data); err != nil {
        log.Printf("Error unmarshalling data: %v", err)
        return StockData{}, err
    }

    return data, nil
}
```

**Explanation:** This snippet demonstrates how to fetch historical stock data from an API. It handles HTTP requests, error management, and JSON unmarshalling.

### Preprocessing Pipeline

```go
package preprocessing

import (
    "math"
    "log"
)

// NormalizeData normalizes the input data
func NormalizeData(data []float64) []float64 {
    var max, min float64
    for _, val := range data {
        if val > max {
            max = val
        }
        if val < min {
            min = val
        }
    }

    normalized := make([]float64, len(data))
    for i, val := range data {
        normalized[i] = (val - min) / (max - min)
    }

    return normalized
}
```

**Explanation:** This code snippet normalizes stock price data, scaling it to a 0-1 range which is crucial for improving the accuracy of machine learning models.

### Model Implementation

```go
package model

import (
    "gonum.org/v1/gonum/stat"
    "log"
)

// TrainLinearModel trains a linear regression model on the input data
func TrainLinearModel(x, y []float64) (slope, intercept float64) {
    slope, intercept = stat.LinearRegression(x, y, nil, false)
    log.Printf("Model trained with slope: %f, intercept: %f", slope, intercept)
    return slope, intercept
}

// Predict makes predictions using the linear model
func Predict(x []float64, slope, intercept float64) []float64 {
    predictions := make([]float64, len(x))
    for i, val := range x {
        predictions[i] = slope*val + intercept
    }
    return predictions
}
```

**Explanation:** This snippet showcases the implementation of a simple linear regression model. The `TrainLinearModel` function calculates the slope and intercept, while the `Predict` function generates predictions based on the trained model.

## Error Handling and Logging

PrediStock includes robust error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure smooth operation and easy debugging. Every module logs key events and errors to provide a clear trace of the application's workflow.

### Example Logging

```go
log.Printf("Successfully fetched data for %s", symbol)
log.Printf("Error processing data: %v", err)
```

These logs help in tracking the application's performance and quickly identifying issues.

## Testing

Thorough testing is conducted to validate the functionality and accuracy of the PrediStock application. Unit tests are implemented for all critical modules, and integration tests ensure that the entire system works cohesively.

### Example Test

```go
package datacollection_test

import (
    "testing"
    "PrediStock/datacollection"
)

func TestFetchData(t *testing.T) {
    data, err := datacollection.FetchData("AAPL")
    if err != nil {
        t.Errorf("Error fetching data: %v", err)
    }

    if len(data) == 0 {
        t.Error("No data fetched")
    }
}
```

This unit test checks the data fetching functionality by ensuring that valid data is returned for a given stock symbol.

## Future Enhancements

While PrediStock is functional, several enhancements can be made:

- **Algorithm Optimization:** Implement more sophisticated algorithms like LSTM for time series prediction.
- **User Interface:** Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
- **Custom Alerts:** Allow users to set custom alerts based on specific criteria.
